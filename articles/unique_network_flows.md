# Unique Network Flows

For performance, ROS2 applications require careful selection of QoS for publishers and subscriptions. Although networks offer various QoS options, ROS2 publishers and subscriptions are unable to use them due to non-unique flows. As a result, ROS2 publishers and subscriptions can only hope to obtain undifferentiated QoS from networks. This ultimately degrades the performance potential of ROS2 applications and wastes networking infrastructure investments.

We propose unique network flows for ROS2 publishers and subscriptions. Our proposal is easy to use, convenient to implement, and minimal. Plus, it respects network-agnostic and non-DDS-middleware-friendly concerns in ROS2.

In this document, we first describe essential background concepts. After that we precisely state the problem and propose a solution to the problem. Existing solutions are compared in the end.

## Background

IP networking [1] is the pre-dominant inter-networking technology used today. Ethernet, WiFi, 4G/5G telecommunication all rely on IP networking.

Streams of IP packets from a given source to destination are called *packet flows* or simply *flows*. Applications can uniquely identify certain flows and explicitly specify what QoS is required from the network for those flows.

### Flow Identifers

The *5-tuple* is a traditional unique identifier for flows. The 5-tuple consists of five parameters: source IP address, source  port, destination IP address, destination port, and the transport protocol (example, TCP/UDP).

IPv6 specifies a *3-tuple* for uniquely identifying flows. The IPv6 3-tuple consists of the source IP address, destination IP address, and the Flow Label. The Flow Label [2] is a 20-bit field in the IPv6 header. It is typically set by the source of the flow. The default Flow Label is zero.

If the 5-tuple is not sufficient, then custom 6-tuples can be created by combining the 5-tuple with the IP Options field or the IP Differentiated Services Code Point sub-field. Such custom 6-tuples are typically used as workarounds for technical difficulties.

### Explicit QoS Specification

We briefly discuss two relevant explicit QoS specification methods for applications -- Differentiated Services and 5G network 5QI.

- Differentiated Services (DS) [3] is a widely-used QoS architecture for IP networks. The required DS-based QoS is set by the application in the 6-bit DS Code Point (DSCP) sub-field of the 8-bit DS field in the IP packet header. For example, DSCP set to 0x2E specifies expedited forwarding as the required QoS. Expedited forwarding is typically used for real-time data such as voice and video.

   ROS2 lacks an API to specify DS-based QoS for publishers and subscriptions. The DSCP value in their flows is therefore set to 0x00. This specifies default forwarding as the required QoS from the network. However, DDS provides the Transport Priority QoS policy to specify DS-based QoS.

   A frustrating problem with DS-based QoS is that intermediate routers can reset or alter the DSCP value within flows. One workaround is to carefully configure intermediate routers such that they retain DSCP markings from incoming to outgoing flows.

- 5G network 5QI: The Network Exposure Function (NEF) [4] in the 5G core network provides robust and secure API for QoS specification. This API enables applications to programmatically (HTTP-JSON) specify required QoS by associating 5G QoS Identifiers (5QIs) to flow identifers, as shown in the figure next. 
  
  ![ROS2 Application 5GS Network Programmability](./ros2-app-5gs-network-programmability.png)
  
  Twenty-six standard 5QIs are identified in the latest release-16 by 3GPP [4:Table 5.7.4-1]. We exemplify a few of them in the table below. The variation in service characteristics of the example 5QIs emphasizes the importance of careful 5QI selection.

  The 5G network also has the ability to sensibly infer 5QI QoS from DS-based QoS markings in flows.

## Problem

All publishers and subscriptions in communicating nodes have the same flow identifers (5-tuple or 3-tuple). This disables explicit network QoS differentiation for publishers and subscriptions in communicating nodes. In other words, publishers and subscriptions in communicating nodes can only be assigned the same network QoS.

We believe the problem occurs by design. For performance reasons, RMW implementations are likely to associate IP address, port, and transport protocol to nodes and not to individual publishers/subscriptions. This is true for all the tier-1 RMW implementations today (Foxy Fitzroy at the time of writing). None of the tier-1 RMW implementations set the IPv6 flow label to differentiate flows of publisher/subscriptions.

### Example

We use the following example to highlight the problem.

Consider a distributed robotics application with communicating nodes N1 and N2. N1 is active on device D1 and N2 on device D2. D1 and D2 are connected by an IP network, say a 5G network.

N1 contains publishers P1 and P2. P1 publishes video data whereas P2 publishes battery status data.

N2 contains subscriptions S1 and S2. S1 receives video from P1 and performs real-time object detection. S2 receives battery data from P2 and performs non-real-time battery management.

The link P1-S1 requires low-latency QoS from the 5G network, say a maximum delay of 5ms. P2-S2 requires default latency QoS i.e., 300ms. Then, by construction, since the flow identifiers of P1-S1 and P2-S2 links are the same, they cannot be assigned the required QoS by the network. Both P1-S1 and P2-S2 can either be assigned QoS with 5ms delay or with 300ms delay. The former case represents a waste of network resources, the latter case degrades performance.

## Proposed Solution

Our proposal to solve the problem is to make the flows of publishers and subscriptions in communicating nodes unique using existing IP header fields.

We construct a publisher/subscription creation-time option called `require_unique_network_flow` as a candidate structure to enable unique identification of flows. This option takes a value from the enumeration shown below.

```cpp
enum unique_network_flow_requirement_t
{
  UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_NOT_REQUIRED = 0,
  UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_STRICTLY_REQUIRED,
  UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_OPTIONALLY_REQUIRED,
  UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_SYSTEM_DEFAULT
}
```

Upon receiving the publisher/subscription creation request, the RMW implementation assigns unique flow identifiers according to the `require_unique_network_flow` option value.  

The default value of the option is `UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_NOT_REQUIRED` which indicates to the RMW implementation that a unique network flow is not required.

The value `UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_STRICTLY_REQUIRED` indicates to the RMW implementation that a unique network flow is strictly required. If not feasible, the RMW implementation must flag an error and not create the associated publisher/subscription.

The value `UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_OPTIONALLY_REQUIRED` enables the RMW implementation to create an unique network flow if feasible. If not, it can continue to create the associated publisher/subscription and not flag an error.

The value `UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_SYSTEM_DEFAULT` delegates the decision to create unique network flows fully to the RMW implementation. The RMW implementation can decide internally on its own or be coerced through side-loading mechanisms to create a unique network flow for the associated publisher/subscription.

The example C++ snippet below shows a node creating two subscriptions and a publisher. Subscription `sub_x_` strictly requires a unique network flow whereas `sub_y_` is indifferent. Publisher `pub_z_`  optionally requires a unique network flow.

```cpp
// Unique network flow strictly required
auto options_x = rclcpp::SubscriptionOptions();
options_x.require_unique_network_flow = UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_STRICTLY_REQUIRED;

sub_x_ = this->create_subscription<std_msgs::msg::String>(
  "topic_x", 10, std::bind(
    &MyNode::topic_x_callback, this,
    _1), options_x);

// Unique network flow not required, relying on default
auto options_2 = rclcpp::SubscriptionOptions();

sub_y_ = this->create_subscription<std_msgs::msg::String>(
  "topic_y", 10, std::bind(
    &MyNode::topic_y_callback, this,
    _1), options_y);

// Unique network flow optionally required
auto options_z = rclcpp::PublisherOptions();
options_z.require_unique_network_flow = RMW_UNIQUE_NETWORK_FLOW_OPTIONALLY_REQUIRED;

pub_z_ = this->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>("topic_z", 10, options_z);
```

In the common case where nodes have a single publisher/subscription per topic, a unique flow is adequately achieved by activating either the publisher- or the subscription-side `require_unique_network_flow`  option. RMW implementations can therefore decide to support either publisher/subscription-side option to enable unique network flows. Support for options on both sides is required in the odd case that a node has multiple publishers/subscriptions for the same topic.

The RMW implementation has several alternatives to convert the `require_unique_network_flow` option to a unique flow identifier visible in packet headers. We list few candidate alternatives next.

If the node is communicating using IPv6, then it can write a unique value (such as a suitable derivative of the RTPS entity ID) into the  Flow Label field. This creates a unique 3-tuple.

Else, if the node is communicating via IPv4, then the RMW implementation can write unique values into the IP Options and DSCP fields. Both alternatives enable the network to infer a custom 6-tuple (traditional 5-tuple plus Options/DSCP) that uniquely identifies flows.

A simple option that works for both IPv6 and IPv4 is to use a unique transport port and accordingly update the transport protocol port fields.

Both DDS and non-DDS RMW implementations can trivially set fields in IP or transport protocol headers using native socket API on all ROS2 platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS).

To enable applications to discern (unique) network flows created by the RMW implementation, we propose a simple interface for getting flow endpoints of publishers/subscriptions. Continuing from the previous code snippet,

```cpp
// Get network flows
auto flows_x = sub_x_->get_network_flow_endpoints();
auto flows_y = sub_y_->get_network_flow_endpoints();

// Ensure sub_x_ has an unique network flow
if (flows_x.size() > 0 && flows_y.size() > 0) {
  for (auto flow_x : flows_x) {
    for (auto flow_y : flows_y) {
      if (flow_x == flow_y) {
        std::runtime_error("Flows are not unique!");
      }
    }
  }
```

The proposed method `get_network_flow_endpoints()` requires RMW implementations to return a vector of byte-arrays/strings that represents the endpoints of network flows of the associated publisher/subscription. This information is custom to each RMW, similar to the existing `get_gid()` method that returns a custom `rmw_gid_t` value. The rationale to consider RMW-custom byte-arrays/strings instead of RMW-common structures is to address leaky-abstraction concerns.

To clarify, the flow endpoints returned by the `get_network_flow_endpoints()` for a publisher represents the endpoints of the channels on the publisher-side only. It does not contain information about endpoints of matched subscriptions. Similarly, the endpoints returned by `get_network_flow_endpoints()` for a subscription has no information about matched publishers.

DDS-based RMW may consider returning a string-serialized variant of the DDS-standard `Locator_t` structure when `get_network_flow_endpoints()` is called.

### Advantages

Our proposal has the following advantages:

- Easy to use: Application developers are only required to decide if unique flow identifiers for publishers/subscriptions are necessary.
- Light-weight implementation: Both non-DDS and DDS RMW can implement the required support conveniently using native socket API with negligible impact on performance.
- Network-agnostic: No particular network is preferred, respecting ROS2 design preferences.
- Minimum change: Introducing the *choice* of unique flow identifiers into the application layer is the minimum framework change required to obtain bespoke QoS from QoS-centric machine-machine network technologies such as 5G.

### Limitations

- If the RMW implementation decides to create a custom 6-tuple using the IPv4 DSCP field, the flows of only up to 64 (2^6) publishers and subscriptions within a node can be uniquely identified. In addition, network administration processes should be notified that the DSCP field is re-purposed as an identifier to prevent misinterpretation.

- Custom parsers built using RMW-specific documentation are required to understand the byte-arrays/strings returned by `get_network_flow_endpoints()`.

## Alternative Solutions

We list a few alternative solutions to the problem that are limited and dissatisfactory.

1. Dedicated nodes: Publishers and subscriptions that require special network QoS can be isolated to dedicated nodes. Such isolation indeed makes their 5-tuple flow identifier unique. However, this breaks the functionality-based node architecture of the application and degrades performance since nodes are heavy-weight structures. In the worst case, a dedicated node per publisher or subscription is required.

2. Custom 6-tuple using side-loaded DDS Transport Priority QoS policies: Conceptually, the custom 6-tuple can be constructed by side-loading unique values into the Transport Priority QoS policy of the DDS RMW implementation. In practice, however, this is difficult to implement for several reasons. First, it expects  DDS RMW side-loading competence from application programmers which is inconvenient. Second, re-purposing DSCP values as unique identifiers is limited to 64 identifiers and requires careful network administration as mentioned before. Third, side-loading support varies across DDS RMW implementations. To the best of our knowledge, none of the tier-1 DDS implementations for ROS2 today (Foxy) support side-loading Transport Priority QoS policies for *select few* publishers and subscriptions in a node due to lack of fine-grained interfaces. A glaring limitation is that this alternative ignores non-DDS RMW.

3. DS-based QoS using side-loaded DDS Transport Priority QoS policies: This gets ahead of the problem by directly specifying the required DS-based QoS through side-loaded Transport Priority QoS policies. However, this suffers from similar impracticalities as the previous alternative. It ignores non-DDS RMW, expects DS competence from programmers, and is not supported by tier-1 RMW implementations.
